"Metal Loop Pack" is collection of short metal loops that loops seamlessly. For your convenience, each loop is divided in several clips: 

 1) "Complete": this is the short song "as recorded", it plays just once from the beginning to the end. It is not meant to be looped but played one time. 

 2) "Intro": to be used as an intro, i.e. the first clip to be played. After this you can play the loop part. 

 3) "Loop": the looped part. If you play this clip immediately after the "intro" part it will seamlessly loop. you can play the "loop" part as many times as you want, in order to get a backgound music as long as needed. 

 4) "End": this is meant to be played immediately after the "Loop" clip. In this way you can end the short song in a convenient way.
